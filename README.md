This binder provides instructions and demo for the [KEGGDecoder](https://github.com/bjtully/BioData/tree/master/KEGGDecoder) tool, which makes a metabolic heatmap. The package was developed by Ben Tully and expanded during the Speeding Up Science workshop by Jay Osvatic, Roth Conrad, Luiz Irber, and Taylor Reiter.
